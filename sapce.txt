//checkinig whether localstorage value is changed or not
// Store a copy of localStorage
let localStorageCopy = JSON.stringify(localStorage);
// Start timer to check for changes
const checkLocalStorageChanges = setInterval(() => {
  // Get current state of localStorage
  const currentLocalStorage = JSON.stringify(localStorage);
  // Compare with the stored copy
  if (currentLocalStorage !== localStorageCopy) {
    // Change detected, trigger notification or execute callback
    console.log('localStorage has been modified.');
    // Update the stored copy with the new state
    localStorageCopy = currentLocalStorage;
  }
}, 1000); // Adjust the interval as needed (e.g., every second)
// Stop checking for changes when no longer needed
// clearInterval(checkLocalStorageChanges);
then call the signout function if value changed
No, the `localStorage` of a web application is specific to that domain. Changes made to the `localStorage` of other websites or domains will not interfere with or affect the `localStorage` of your web application.
Each website has its own isolated storage area for `localStorage`, and the data stored in one website's `localStorage` cannot be accessed or modified by other websites. This is known as the "same-origin policy" enforced by web browsers for security reasons.
So, the approach I mentioned earlier to detect changes in the `localStorage` will only monitor changes made within the same web application or domain. Changes made to the `localStorage` of other websites will not trigger the detection mechanism in your web application.
